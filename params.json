{"name":"OSRE1","tagline":"The Open Source Risk Engine (OSRE) Project.","body":"OSRE1: The Open Source Risk Engine Project.\r\n=====\r\nThis is the first version of OSRE.\r\n\r\nThe Open Source Risk Engine (OSRE) was developed initially in Kyoto University, Graduate School of Engineering, Department of Urban Management, in order to meet the requirements of the \"Capstone Project\" for the Masters Degree in Engineering. The purpose of the \"Capstone Project\" was to develop multi-hazards open-source software that can estimate the risk (damage) of a particular site (object) given a hazard and the vulnerability with their associate probability distributions. The original project team was made up of four Master Degree students (Christakis Mina, Masaki Higuchi, Koichiro Danno, Puay How Tion) and guided by Professors Scawthorn, Kiyono and Ono. The software was developed in Visual Basic .net 2003. Several modules of the program were initially coded in FORTRAN, C and Basic and then converted into Visual Basic .net.\r\n\r\nOSRE is licensed under the Open Source Academic Free License V. 2.1\r\n\r\nOSRE uses the NPlot charting library for .NET.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
