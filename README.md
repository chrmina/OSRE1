OSRE1: The Open Source Risk Engine Project.
=====

The Open Source Risk Engine (OSRE) was developed initially in Kyoto University, Graduate School of Engineering, Department of Urban Management, in order to meet the requirements of the "Capstone Project" for the Masters Degree in Engineering. The purpose of the "Capstone Project" was to develop multi-hazards open-source software that can estimate the risk (damage) of a particular site (object) given a hazard and the vulnerability with their associate probability distributions. The original project team was made up of four Master Degree students (Christakis Mina, Masaki Higuchi, Koichiro Danno, Puay How Tion) and guided by Professors Scawthorn, Kiyono and Ono. The software was developed in Visual Basic .net 2003. Several modules of the program were initially coded in FORTRAN, C and Basic and then converted into Visual Basic .net.
